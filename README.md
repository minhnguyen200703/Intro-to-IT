RMIT Recommendations and Reviews (3R): The name is simple, it tells us exactly what it does. It is a recommendation for the courses mapping and reviewing the lecturer, their respective courses. We decided on this name because it is easy to remember and catchy for the students due to it being only a word and number. It is also a unique name which makes it stand out from its competitors, most other websites prefer having longer names to look good to the users but we think that the shorter name would be short and concise, therefore would draw in more users. We added RMIT because it is a system designed specifically for RMIT students.
